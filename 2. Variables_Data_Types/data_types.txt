A variavble is a container to store data
Variables can be of sofferent types like
1) Int
2) Float
3) Char (1 byte)
4) Double
5) Boolean


To define a Variable
int sum = 34;
This defines a Variable 'sum' with the value 34


We can also define multiple Variables
int a=4, char letter=6;


Like in python, here also there are global and local variables






VARIABLE SCOPE

                 anywhere else
Global variables: Theya re defines outside a function and can be accesed form anywhere


Global and Local variables can have the same name in the program
