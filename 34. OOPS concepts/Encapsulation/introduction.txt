These are some comments for future refernece
To acheive encapsulation in C++, we use classes.


In every class, there are:
1) data members
2) member functions
We can use both these things both in the function and outside the function
and also in an inhertited class

So to control this flow of access, we use access modifiers.
There are 3 types of access modifiers:
1) Public
--> Objects can access the data members and function outside
    the class also and also in  a derived class

2) Private
--> We can access the data members inside the class ONLY

3) Protected
--> This is just like private but we can use the data members
    in a derived/inhertited class also


ADVANTAGES OF ENCAPSULATION
- Good Coding practice, useful in interviews
- Increased security of data
