POLYMORPHISM TYPES

1) Compile Time
  - Function Overloading
  - Operator Overloading
2) Run Time
  - Virtual Functions


Function Overloading
When there are different functions with the same name but not
the same function or with different arguments

Operator Overloading
When we define a different function to a pre-defined function
like +, -, * etc.

Virtual Functions
