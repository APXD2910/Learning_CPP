# Learning C++
#### This is me learning c++ through a youtube course by aman dhattarwal and CodeWithHarry.

#### I have saved the notes of each of the lectures by aman dhattarwal's channel 'Apna College' in  a folder called "0. NOTES".


## Please check out Aman Dhattarwal's YouTube channel 'Apna College'
### He and his team are working very hard for providing free education for all.

- This is the link to his [playlist of c++](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqMhTWNBTe0b2nM6JHVCnAkhQRGiZMSJ) for placement preparation and for competitive programing
- Hell, his videos don't even have ads in them.

### Though it might seem that I am sponsered or I am promoting his channel, but it is nothing like that.
### I'm just a huge fan of his work.
