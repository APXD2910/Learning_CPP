SPACE COMPLEXITY

Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken
by a program to run as a function of the length of the input. It is
directly proportional to the largest memory your program acquires at
any instanct during run time.

Running time should be minimum and size should be less

int n;
cin >> n;
a = 0;
for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
    a += 1;
}

- Here we can see that there are 3 int variables and integer variables
  have a size of 4 bytes. So it's space complexity is 12 bytes.
- We can say that space complexity is independent of the input.

Suppose we have an array of size n:
int arr[n];
