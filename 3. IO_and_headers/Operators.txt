ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
This contains +, - , *, /, %

/ returns integer value
4/5 gives 0

Increment and decrement Operators
If value of a is 4;
a++ = Here a becomes 5 after printing
a-- = Here a becomes 3 after printing
++a = Here a becomes 5 before printing
--a = Here a becomes 3 before printing




ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
= is the assignment operator 
int a = 4;
char as = "C";


+= , -=, *=, /=    are normal like in python



COMPARISION OPERATORS
int a = 4, b = 5;

(a == b) (False)
Here it is necessary to use Paranthesis ()
(a < b) (True)
(a > b) (False)
(a >= b) (False)
(a <= b) (True)
(a != b) (True)






LOGICAL OPERATORS
1- if both are True, && is True
2- if even one is True, || is True
3- in not operator, it reverses it all
   (!(a==b)) returns True






BITWISE OPERATORS
& OPERATOR 
0 & 1 will give 0 
1 & 0 will give 0 
1 & 1 will give 1 
0 & 0 will give 0 


OR OPERATOR
0 & 1 will give 1 
1 & 0 will give 1 
1 & 1 will give 1 
0 & 0 will give 0 

XOR OPERATOR
0 & 1 will give 1 
1 & 0 will give 1 
1 & 1 will give 0
0 & 0 will give 0 


ONES COMPLEMENT OPERATOR
0 will give 1
1 will give 0 

LEFT SHIFT OPERATOR
4 << 1
(0100)
=1000

RIGHT SHIFT
4 >> 1
(0100)
=0010



a << n = a*2^n
a >> n = a/2^n






MISCELLANEOUS OPERATOR
sizeof() => it gives the size of a particular variable, int is 4 bytes

Condition>?x:y    =>


example:

int a = 10;
int b = 5;

int c = a>b?a-b:b-a

It is basically a if else statement





Cast  => Changes from one data type to another data type
char charac = 'a';
int(charac)
cout << charac;
It will print ascii value o a which is 97






&      =>  Returns the address of a variable



*        => Pointer to a variable
