ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
This contains +, - , *, /, %

/ returns integer value
4/5 gives 0

Increment and decrement Operators
If value of a is 4;
a++ = Here a becomes 5 after printing
a-- = Here a becomes 3 after printing
++a = Here a becomes 5 before printing
--a = Here a becomes 3 before printing




ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
= is the assignment operator 
int a = 4;
char as = "C";



COMPARISION OPERATORS
int a = 4, b = 5;

(a == b) (False)
Here it is necessary to use Paranthesis ()
(a < b) (True)
(a > b) (False)
(a >= b) (False)
(a <= b) (True)
(a != b) (True)






LOGICAL OPERATORS
1- if both are True, && is True
2- if even one is True, || is True
3- in not operator, it reverses it all
   (!(a==b)) returns True
